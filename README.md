## Finding the best starting five players for the Chicago Bulls in the 2019-20 NBA season
The objective is to find the best five starting players for the team while staying within our budget of $118 million for player contracts in the upcoming 2019-20 NBA season.
The Chicago Bulls ranked 27th out of 30 teams in the previous season based on win-loss record, and our budget is ranked 26th out of 30 teams. Our goal is to improve our team's performance in the upcoming season by selecting the best starting five players who are affordable.
The analysis will also take into account the performance of players from other teams who are within our budget and can potentially improve our team's performance.

### Steps Involved Include:
- Collecting and cleaning data on player contracts and performance statistics for the 2018-19 NBA season.
- Identifying the key performance indicators for each position (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, center) and ranking players based on these indicators.
- Using statistical analysis and visualization techniques to identify the top players for each position within our budget.
- Analyzing the team's overall balance and synergy to ensure that the selected players complement each other and form an effective starting lineup.
- Providing recommendations to the general manager on the best five starting players for the team.
